### A Georges Brunet Program

This project focuses on the program to organize the 2017 Serutcurtsatad Futsal Tournament. Serutcurtsatad is a fictional Country, with
fictional cities, and fictional futsal teams. Also, futsal is 5V5 soccer. This program enables the user to enter his or her team as
well as navigate other options that come about when organizing a tournament. These options include: 

  - building the tournament (building the 4 original teams in the tournament before any input then displaying them) 
  
  - displaying the currently listed teams(after entering/deleting a team) 
  
  - entering a team (this prompts the user to name his team, name the city they are representing, the coach, and the five players in a separate menu) 
  
  - deleting a team (thus deleting the all its info as well as city if it is the only team from there)
  
  - viewing team info (such as city, coach, starters)
  
  - viewing teams per city (displays the number of teams followed by the names of the city's respective teams)
  
  - viewing the tournament schedule (the amount of match days is equivalent to the amount of teams in tournament - 1)
  
  - starting the tournament. This prompts the user to another menu where different options become available, such as:
          - Match Day Match fixing - This displays the current Match Day's matches in a numerated list. Upon selecting
          a match, the user is asked to input the score, and name of the goal scorer (IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW YOUR PLAYERS' NAMES)
          
          - View Tournament Table - this displays in a table-like structure the wins, draws, losses, away goals, home goals, and the 
          goal value (in case there's a tie)
          
          - View top 5 goal scorers - This displays the tournaments top five players who haved scored the most
          
          - Advance Match Day - This option advances the match day if all the current Match days' scores and goal scorers are input
          
          - Returning to main - (This deletes the current tournament)
          
  - Quitting the program
  
  
 Notes: The 2017 Serutcurtsatad Futsal Tournament must contain at least 3 teams to start and can contain 6 teams at most. This means
 there can be 5 games at most per match day, as a team will play against every team except itself. As well as for the sake of 
 simplicity. A team requires a name, a city to represent, 5 players, and a coach to participate. The winning team receives nothing
 other than glory.
 
 This repo may still be subject to change in the days to come.
